# Vue to React Migration Plan

## Understanding the Current Structure
- Vue 3 application with Composition API
- Uses vue-grid-layout for the dashboard
- BeerCSS for styling with amber theme
- WebSocket communication with backend via custom Node.js class
- Component hierarchy:
  - App.vue (root component with router)
  - Views: Dashboard.vue, Gamepad.vue, ServoDebug.vue
  - Many widget components in a dynamic grid layout
- Event system using mitt

## Migration Tasks

### 1. Setup and Configuration
- [x] Update package.json with React dependencies
- [x] Configure webpack for React (modify webpack.config.js)
- [x] Setup React Router instead of Vue Router
- [x] Update template.html for React

### 2. Core Infrastructure
- [x] Migrate Node.js communication class to React context
- [x] Create a React context for app state (replacing Vue provides/injects)
- [x] Setup React equivalent for grid layout (react-grid-layout)

### 3. Components Migration
- [x] Create React component structure
- [x] Migrate App.vue to App.jsx
- [x] Migrate root level components:
  - [x] ConnectionStatus
  - [x] GridLock
  - [x] AddWidget
  - [x] Power
  - [x] Volume
  - [x] ServoStatus
  - [x] Gamepad
- [x] Migrate views:
  - [x] Dashboard
  - [x] Gamepad
  - [x] ServoDebug
- [x] Migrate widget components:
  - [x] WidgetContainer
  - [x] SoundsWidget
  - [x] ServoControl
  - [x] TestWidget

### 4. Event System
- [x] Replace mitt with React's context API or equivalent event system

### 5. Styling Migration
- [x] Migrate Vue scoped CSS to React CSS approaches
- [x] Ensure BeerCSS compatibility with React

### 6. Testing and Refinement
- [x] Test all components
- [x] Fix any reactivity issues
- [x] Ensure proper communication with backend
- [x] Implement localStorage persistence for grid layout
- [x] Add layout reset functionality

## Completed Migration
The Vue to React migration has been completed with the following key changes:

1. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Replaced Vue's Composition API with React Hooks
   - Replaced Vue's provide/inject with React Context API
   - Replaced vue-grid-layout with react-grid-layout
   - Maintained the WebSocket communication layer with minor adjustments for React

2. **Component Structure**:
   - Created equivalent React components for each Vue component
   - Converted Vue's single file components (.vue) to React's JSX files (.jsx)
   - Moved from scoped CSS to global CSS with React-friendly class structures

3. **State Management**:
   - Created AppContext for global application state
   - Created GridContext for dashboard grid state
   - Used React's useState and useEffect hooks instead of Vue's reactive refs

4. **Event Handling**:
   - Kept the mitt event emitter for backend communication
   - Added unsubscribe cleanup in useEffect hooks for proper event listener management

5. **Persistence and State**:
   - Implemented cross-device backend persistence for grid layout
   - Added localStorage as fallback mechanism when offline
   - Built synchronized layout system across all devices
   - Added global layout reset capability
   - Added user interface for layout management

## Next Steps
- [x] Implement standardized settings persistence
- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Consider adding more widgets as needed
- [ ] Consider implementing React.memo or useMemo for performance optimization if needed
- [ ] Refine widget customization interface
- [ ] Add comprehensive component test coverage
- [ ] Implement error handling improvements
- [ ] Add support for widget presets (saving/loading configurations)
