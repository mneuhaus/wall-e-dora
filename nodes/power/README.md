# Power Node

## Purpose
The Power Node monitors the robot's battery status and power consumption, providing critical information for operation and safety shutdowns at low battery levels.

## Overview
The power package provides battery monitoring and power management for the Wall-E robot using an INA226 current/voltage sensor. It tracks battery state, estimates remaining runtime, and implements safety shutdown at low battery levels.

## Log Output Format

The power node produces a single consolidated log line with the following format:

```
Power: 11.77V (89.7%) 0.50A 5.90W | Avg: 5.14W | Runtime: 03:37 | Est.Cap: 2.50Ah | Discharge: 26.4%/hr | Time to 20%: 3.6h | Avg current: 0.45A
```

This includes:
- Current voltage, state of charge percentage, current, and power
- Average power consumption over time
- Estimated runtime until reaching 20% battery threshold
- Estimated battery capacity in amp-hours
- Battery discharge rate in percentage per hour
- Time until battery reaches 20% threshold
- Average current draw
