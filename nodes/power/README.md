# Power Node

## Purpose
The Power Node monitors the robot's battery status and power consumption, providing critical information for operation and safety shutdowns at low battery levels.

## Overview
The power package provides battery monitoring and power management for the Wall-E robot using an INA226 current/voltage sensor. It tracks battery state, estimates remaining runtime, and implements safety shutdown at low battery levels.
